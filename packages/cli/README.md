Command-line interface to work with OpenAPI files

![Demo Video](https://github.com/readyapi/cli/assets/6374090/ebd02178-503d-4a70-b292-a52a74b35008)

## Features

- Format & validate OpenAPI files
- Upload your OpenAPI files to Scalar
- Get a fully mocked API for testing purposes
- Preview your API reference
- Bundle multiple OpenAPI files

## Quickstart

```bash
npx @readyapi/cli help
```

## Installation

If you really want to become friends you should install the CLI:

```bash
npm -g install @readyapi/cli
```

Otherwise just prefix all commands with `npx @readyapi/cli` instead of `readyapi`. That’s fine, too.

## Commands

### format

The given JSON file will be formatted with Prettier.

```bash
readyapi format
readyapi format openapi.json --output openapi.yaml
readyapi format https://example.com/openapi.json --output openapi.json
```

### validate

To check whether your OpenAPI file adheres to the Swagger 2.0, OpenAPI 3.0 or OpenAPI 3.1 specification, run the following command:

```bash
readyapi validate
readyapi validate openapi.json
readyapi validate https://example.com/openapi.json
```

### share

To quickly share an OpenAPI file or reference with someone, you can use the share command:

```bash
readyapi share
readyapi share openapi.json
```

This will upload your OpenAPI file to the [Readyapi Sandbox](https://sandbox.readyapi.khulnasoft.com/) to give you a public reference URL and a public URL to your OpenAPI JSON file.

### reference

You can quickly spin up a local server with an API reference based on your OpenAPI file.

```bash
readyapi reference
readyapi reference openapi.json
readyapi reference openapi.json --port 1234
readyapi reference openapi.json --watch
readyapi reference https://example.com/openapi.json --watch
```

### mock

We can even mock your API, and it’s just one command:

```bash
readyapi mock
```

This will boot up a server on port 3000 which gives you an API returning the dummy data according to your schema.

If you’d like to watch for file changes (to the OpenAPI file), do it like this:

```bash
readyapi mock openapi.json --watch
```

You can also change the port like this:

```bash
readyapi mock openapi.json --watch --port 8080
```

And it even works with URLs:

```bash
readyapi mock https://example.com/openapi.json --watch
```

### bundle

> Warning! The bundle command isn’t ready for production yet. Circular dependencies are not supported yet.

Some OpenAPI files reference other files from the file system or an URL. You can bundle those files and make them a single file:

```bash
readyapi bundle openapi.json --output bundle.json
```

If you don’t provide an `output` file name, the input file will be overwritten.

### init

If you’re tired of passing the file name again and again, just configure it once:

```bash
readyapi init
```

This will create a `readyapi.config.json` file for you. All commands will use the configured OpenAPI file by default.

## Options

### --version

If you want to check which version of the CLI is installed, just run this:

```bash
readyapi --version
```

### --help

```bash
readyapi --help
```

## GitHub Actions

To validate your OpenAPI file in GitHub Actions, add this workflow:

```yml
# .github/workflows/validate-openapi-file.yml
name: Validate OpenAPI File

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
      - name: Validate OpenAPI File
        # Replace `./my-openapi-file.json` with the correct path and filename for your project.
        # Or: run `npx @readyapi/cli init` and add the config file to your repository.
        run: npx @readyapi/cli validate ./my-openapi-file.json
```

## Development

Set up the development environment:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm @readyapi/cli --version
```

To symlink the package and use it globally on your machine:

```bash
pnpm cli:link
readyapi --version
```
